Send me URLs, and I'll try to convert them to videos\!  
You can also use the commands /vidify and /gifify when sending URLs or replying to a message with URLs\.

To trim the video or gif, set the start time and either the end time or duration:
\- `s=timestamp` or `start=timestamp` will set the start time
\- `e=timestamp` or `end=timestamp` will set the end time
\- `d=timestamp`, `dur=timestamp`, or `duration=timestamp` will set the duration

The timestamp can be a number of seconds, `MM:SS`, or `HH:MM:SS` \(leading zeros are not required\)\. Timestamps can also be a number of seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds with `s`, `ms`, or `us` after\. Any seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds value also accepts decimal places, e\.g\. `12.432s` or `12:03:37.123`\.
